# Random Error Detection

## Overview

At network run time, the calculation with the same inputs may produce different outputs.

If such random issues happen, run training twice and collect operator results \(dump data\) from both runs. Compare the results to quickly identify operators that cause randomness.

## Procedure

1. Run training on the NPU and collect dump data by referring to  [Dumping User Model on NPU](./network_accuracy_comparison.md#dumping-user-model-on-npu). The data will be saved to the  **precision_data/npu/debug_0**  directory by default.
2. Copy the preceding data to the  **precision_data/npu/debug_1**  directory.

    ```bash
    mv precision_data/npu/debug_0/ precision_data/npu/debug_1
    ```

3. Run training on the NPU again and collect dump data. The data will be saved to the  **precision_data/npu/debug_0**  directory by default.
4. Start the precision_tool command line.

    ```bash
    python3 ./precision_tool/cli.py
    ```

    Enter the command line interface.

    ```bash
    PrecisionTool >
    ```

    > [!NOTE]NOTE
    > To exit, press  **Ctrl+C**.

5. Run the  [vc -lt \[left_path\] -rt \[right_path\] -g \[graph\]](precision_tool_ommand_ref.md#vc--lt-left_path--rt-right_path--g-graph)  command to compare the data of the entire network.

    **vc -lt precision_data/npu/debug_1/dump/20211016164504/1/ge_default_20211016164504_1/1/0  -rt precision_data/npu/debug_0/dump/20211016180613/1/ge_default_20211016180613_1/1/0**

    The accuracy comparison result is generated in the  **out_dir**  directory. For details about how to analyze data, see  [Network Accuracy Comparison Result File](network_accuracy_comparison_result_file.md).

6. For the preceding results, alternatively use the  [ni \(-n\) \[op_name\] -g \[graph\] -a \[attr\] -s \[save subgraph depth\]](precision_tool_ommand_ref.md#ni--n-op_name--g-graph--a-attr--s-save-subgraph-depth) command of precision_tool for per-layer analysis.

    **python3 precision_tool/cli.py**

    **PrecisionTool \>  ni xxx**

    If both  **debug_0**  and  **debug_1**  exist in the  **precision_data/npu/**  directory, the  **ni**  command parses the dump files with the same operator name in the two folders. The data differences can be clearly seen from the parsing result.

## Analysis Principles

The preliminary location of fishy operators is generally based on the cosine similarity in the network-wide comparison result. A high cosine similarity does not necessarily indicate that no problem exists, but a low cosine similarity means a big chance of problem occurrence. The accuracy comparison result can offer a general analysis direction.

1. Determine whether an error operator is a custom operator based on the operator type.
    - For a custom operator, check whether the implementation logic of the operator is consistent with that of the benchmark by inspecting the command output of  [ni \(-n\) \[op_name\] -g \[graph\] -a \[attr\] -s \[save subgraph depth\]](precision_tool_ommand_ref.md#ni--n-op_name--g-graph--a-attr--s-save-subgraph-depth)  or the dump analysis report.
    - For a built-in CANN operator, if the operator input or output type is float16, you can switch the operator type to float32 by using either of the following methods:
        1. \(Recommended\) Method 1: Modify the blocklist, trustlist, and graylist for the operator that uses the mixed precision mode. For details, see  [Training with Mixed Precision](../performance_tuning/mixed_precision_training.md).
        2. Method 2: Use the  **keep_dtype_scope**  API to preserve the original precision for a selected operator.

            ```python
            from npu_bridge.npu_init import *
            with npu_scope.keep_dtype_scope():   
              y = tf.mul(x1,x2)
            ```
