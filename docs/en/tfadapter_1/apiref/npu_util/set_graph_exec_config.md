# set_graph_exec_config

## Description

Sets the compilation and execution options for a computational graph. After this API is called, configured attributes are added to the fetch node.

## Prototype

```python
def set_graph_exec_config(fetch, dynamic_input=False,
                          dynamic_graph_execute_mode="dynamic_execute",
                          dynamic_inputs_shape_range=None,
                          is_train_graph=False,
                          experimental_config=None)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fetch | Input | Node executable in the graph. It can be an operation, list, tuple, or tensor, or the name of a tensor.<br>Do not set it to tf.no_op, because this node will be removed when TensorFlow optimizes the graph. |
| dynamic_input | Input | Note: This parameter will be discarded in later versions. You are advised not to set it.<br>Dynamic input flag.<br><br>  - True<br>  - False (default) |
| dynamic_graph_execute_mode | Input | Note: This parameter will be discarded in later versions. You are advised not to set it.<br>Execution mode of a dynamic input. That is, this parameter takes effect when dynamic_input is set to True.<br>dynamic_execute: dynamic graph compilation. In this mode, the shape range configured in dynamic_inputs_shape_range is used for compilation. |
| dynamic_inputs_shape_range | Input | Note: This parameter will be discarded in later versions. You are advised not to set it.<br>Shape range of each dynamic input. If a graph has two dataset inputs and one placeholder input, the configuration is as the example shown below.<br>dynamic_inputs_shape_range="getnext:[128 ,3~5, 2~128, -1],[64 ,3~5, 2~128, -1];data:[128 ,3~5, 2~128, -1]"<br>Precautions:<br><br>  - When this parameter is used, constants cannot be set to user inputs.<br>  - getnext indicates the dataset inputs and data indicates the placeholder inputs.<br>  - The size of a static dimension is specified by a determinant value. The size range of a dynamic dimension is specified by using a tilde (~). A dynamic dimension without size range specified is denoted by –1.<br>  - Assume that your graph has three dataset inputs but the first dataset input has a static shape; the static shape must be specified as shown below.dynamic_inputs_shape_range="getnext:[3,3,4,10],[-1,3,2~1000,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1]"<br>  - For scalar inputs, you also need to fill in the shape range by using square brackets ([]). No space is allowed before [].<br>  - If there are multiple getnext inputs or data inputs on the network, the input ordering must be preserved. For example:If there are multiple dataset inputs on the network:def func(x):<br>   x = x + 1<br>   y = x + 2<br>   return x,y<br>dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(min_size, max_size)<br>dataset = dataset.map(func)<br>Assume that the first input of the network is x (with shape range [3~5]) and the second input is y (with shape range [3~6]). When configuring the dynamic ranges in dynamic_inputs_shape_range, the ordering must be preserved.<br>dynamic_inputs_shape_range ="getnext:[3~5],[3~6]"<br>If there are multiple placeholder inputs on the network:If the placeholder names are not specified, for example:<br>x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)<br>y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)<br># Set the dynamic ranges of the placeholder inputs in dynamic_inputs_shape_range in the same order as that defined in the script. That is, the first input x (with shape range [3-5]) goes first and the second input y (with shape range [3-6]) follows.<br>dynamic_inputs_shape_range= "data:[3~5],[3~6]"<br>If the placeholder names are specified, for example:<br>x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32,)<br>y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32,)<br>The inputs are in the alphabetical order of the name fields,<br>that is, when setting dynamic_inputs_shape_range, the first input y (with shape range [3~6]) goes first and the second input x (with shape range [3~5]) follows.<br>dynamic_inputs_shape_range = "data:[3~6],[3~5]"<br> NOTICE: If the placeholder names are not specified in the network script, the placeholders are named in the following format:<br>xxx_0, xxx_1, xxx_2, ...<br>The content following the underscore (_) is the sequence index of a placeholder in the network script. Placeholders are arranged in alphabetical order of the index. If the number of placeholders is greater than 10, the sequence is xxx_0 -> xxx_10 -> xxx_2 -> xxx_3. In the network script, the placeholder with index 10 is placed before the placeholder with index 2. As a result, the defined shape range does not match the input placeholder.<br>To avoid this problem, when the number of input placeholders is greater than 10, you are advised to specify the placeholder names in the network script.

## Returns

fetch

## Restrictions

If both graph-level and session-level parameters are set, the graph-level parameters take precedence over session-level ones.

## Example

Generally, gradient update operations are performed in training networks. The return value of the gradient update operation can be used as the  **fetch**  argument in  **set_graph_exec_config**.

```python
from npu_bridge.estimator.npu import util
train_op = util.set_graph_exec_config(train_op, 
                                     dynamic_input=True,
                                     dynamic_inputs_shape_range="data:[1~2];getnext:[1~50,1~50],[1~50,1~50]")
```
