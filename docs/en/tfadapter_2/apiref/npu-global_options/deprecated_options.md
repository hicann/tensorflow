# Options That Will Be Deprecated in Later Versions

## op_select_implmode

Operator implementation mode. Certain operators built in the NPU can be implemented in either high-precision or high-performance mode at model build time. The value can be set to either of the following:

- high_precision: high-precision implementation mode. In high-precision mode, Taylor's theorem or Newton's method is used to improve operator precision with float16 input.
- high_performance (default): high-performance implementation mode. In high-performance mode, the optimal performance is implemented without affecting the network precision (float16).

The default value is None, indicating that the configuration is disabled.

Example:

```python
npu.global_options().op_select_implmode="high_precision"
```

## optypelist_for_implmode

List of operator types (separated by commas) that use the mode specified by the op_select_implmode parameter. Currently, Pooling, SoftmaxV2, LRN, and ROIAlign operators are supported.

Use this parameter in conjunction with op_select_implmode, for example:

```python
npu.global_options().op_select_implmode="high_precision"
npu.global_options().optypelist_for_implmode="Pooling,SoftmaxV2"
```

The default value is None, indicating that the configuration is disabled.

## variable_format_optimize

Variable format optimization enable.

- True: enabled.
- False: disabled.

To improve training efficiency, variables are converted to a format better suited for NPU execution during variable initialization performed by the network. Enable or disable this function as needed.

The default value is None, indicating that the configuration is disabled.

Example:

```python
npu.global_options().variable_format_optimize=True
```

## op_debug_level

Whether to enable operator debugging. The values are as follows:

- 0: disables operator debug.
- 1: Enables operator debug. TBE instruction mapping files are generated in the kernel_meta directory under the training script execution path, including operator CCE files (.cce), Python-CCE mapping files (_loc.json), .o files, and .json files. These files are used for AI Core error analysis with related tools.

  Note: For the Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT, no TBE instruction mapping files are generated.

- 2: Enables operator debug. TBE instruction mapping files are generated in the kernel_meta directory under the training script execution path, including operator CCE files (.cce), Python-CCE mapping files (_loc.json), .o files, and .json files. The compilation optimization of the CCE compiler is disabled and the CCE compiler debugging function is enabled (by setting the compiler option to -O0-g). These files are used for AI Core error analysis with related tools.

  Note: For the Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT, no TBE instruction mapping files are generated.

- 3: disables operator debug. The operator .o and .json files are retained in the kernel_meta folder in the training script execution directory.
- 4: disables operator debug. The operator binary (.o) and operator description file (.json) are retained, and a TBE instruction mapping file (.cce) and a UB fusion description file ({$kernel_name}_compute.json) are generated in the kernel_meta folder under the training script execution directory.

  Note:
  
  - For the Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT, neither TBE instruction mapping files nor UB fusion compute description files are generated.
  - If this option is set to 0 and op_debug_config is configured, the operator compilation directory kernel_meta is still generated in the current execution path during training. The content generated in the directory is subject to op_debug_config.
  - You are advised to set this option to 0 or 3 for training. To locate AI Core errors, set this parameter to 1 or 2, which might compromise the network performance.
  - If this option is set to 2 (the CCE compiler is enabled), it cannot be used together with the oom option in op_debug_config. Otherwise, an AI Core error is reported. The following is an example of the error message:
  
    ```text
    ...there is an aivec error exception, core id is 49, error ode = 0x4 ...
    ```

  - If this parameter is set to 2 (the CCE compiler is enabled), the size of the operator kernel file (*.o file) increases. In dynamic shape scenarios, all possible scenarios are traversed during operator build, which may cause operator build failures due to large operator kernel files. In this case, 2 is not recommended.
  
    If the build failure is caused by the large operator kernel file, the following log is displayed:

    ```text
    message:link error ld.lld: error: InputSection too large for range extension thunk ./kernel_meta_xxxxx.o:(xxxx)
    ```

  - If the value of this parameter is not 0, you can use the debug_dir parameter to specify the path for storing debugging-related process files.
  - If this parameter is set to 0 and NPU_COLLECT_PATH is set, the operator compilation directory kernel_meta is generated in the current path after the command is executed. If ASCEND_WORK_PATH is set, kernel_meta is generated in the path specified by the environment variable. For details about environment variables, see [Environment Variables](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/en/CANNCommunityEdition/latest/maintenref/envvar/envref_07_0001.html).
  - When the debug function is enabled, if the model contains the following merged compute and communication (MC2) operators, the \*.o, \*.json, and \*.cce files of the operators are not generated in the operator build folder kernel_meta.MatMulAllReduce

    ```text
    MatMulAllReduce
    MatMulAllReduceAddRmsNorm
    AllGatherMatMul
    MatMulReduceScatter
    AlltoAllAllGatherBatchMatMul
    BatchMatMulReduceScatterAlltoAll
    ```

The default value is None, indicating that the configuration is disabled.

Example:

```python
npu.global_options().op_debug_level=0
```

## graph_memory_max_size

Sizes of the network static memory and the maximum dynamic memory (used in earlier versions). In the current version, this parameter does not take effect. The system dynamically allocates memory resources based on the actual memory usage of the network.

## variable_memory_max_size

Size of the variable memory (used in earlier versions).

In the current version, this parameter does not take effect. The system dynamically allocates memory resources based on the actual memory usage of the network.
